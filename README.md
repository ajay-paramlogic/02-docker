# Docker


## What is Docker?
Docker is a tool that allows you to run programs in a controlled environment called a container. Think of a container as a virtual computer that has everything the program needs to run, such as its code, libraries, and dependencies.


## What problems does it solve?

Portability: One of the primary benefits of Docker is its ability to create a consistent runtime environment for applications. Docker containers can be deployed on any system running Docker, regardless of the underlying operating system or hardware.

Dependency management: Docker helps developers manage application dependencies by allowing them to package an application and its dependencies into a single container. This makes it easier to ensure that the application runs the same way on all systems.

Isolation: Docker provides containerization technology that isolates applications from each other and from the underlying host system. This means that applications can run reliably without interference from other applications or changes to the host system.

Efficiency: Docker allows developers to share common components between different applications, reducing the amount of resources needed to run multiple applications on a single system. This can lead to significant cost savings in terms of hardware, maintenance, and operational expenses.

Security: Docker provides a secure runtime environment that can help protect applications from external threats. Because containers are isolated from each other and the underlying system, vulnerabilities in one container are less likely to affect other containers or the host system.
